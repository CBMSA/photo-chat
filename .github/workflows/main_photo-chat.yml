üîê Required Secret

You need to add 1 secret in your GitHub repo:

1. AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN
Get this from Azure:

Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí Static Web App ‚Üí "Deployment Token"

Copy and paste it into GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions





---

üö´ Remove

You should delete or rename this file if it exists:

.github/workflows/deploy-java-to-appservice.yml

Because it's still pointing to Maven/JAR logic and will conflict.


---

‚úÖ Want Help?

I can:

Generate the file for you

Zip it into your project

Push sample code to GitHub (if you give me structure)

Generate Firebase .env configs for GitHub Actions


Let me know what you‚Äôd like next.
